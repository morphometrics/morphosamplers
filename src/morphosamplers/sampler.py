    Sample a volume around an arbitrary gridded surface.

    For each "root" point on the surface, samples are extracted along a line normal

    The spacing between points on the surface (unless a pre-generated surface is given) and
    between the sampled points is equal to sampling_spacing. The sampled lines are then
    re-packed into a volume with the same dimensions as the surface, but "flattened".

    For example: a gridded surface of shape (50, 30), sampling_thickness of 10 and spacing of 3,
